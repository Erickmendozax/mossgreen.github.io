Spring Professional Certification Update in June 2019.

Changes:
1. Less content on AOP topic. From 14% to 8%.
2. More Spring Boot content, from 14% to 32%.

From my perspective, AOP is more low level technology, Spring prefer to do the magic unviled, unless you're a pro. I compared the Pro Action Spring 4th edition and 5 edition, the biggest difference is that the latter has very limited pages on AOP now.
