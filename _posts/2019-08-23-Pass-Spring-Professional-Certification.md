Got Spring Professional Certificated at Aug 2019

## What is Spring Professional Certification?

The Spring Professional certification exam is designed to test and validate your understanding of and familiarity with Spring Frame.


## Why do you want to pass it?

Personally speaking, I just set a goal that needs to achieve. I learn Spring by passing this certification.

There was a discussion on "[Is Spring certification worth anything?](https://coderanch.com/t/550694/frameworks/Spring-certification-worth)".

 My answer is: the certification itself is worth nothing but the knowledge is worthless. You don't have to pass this certification to gain knowledge. This certificate is just a test that you have gained this knowledge.


## How to prepare for it?

After I did some research on other people's study notes, I believe it's getting harder and harder to get this certification.

### Old Version VS New Version

1. Version 4.2
    You can find a summary about version 4.2 exam from [Vojtech Ruzicka's Programming Blog](https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/exam-notes-pivotal-certified-spring-professional/).
    
    And study notes from Vitalie: [Core Spring 4.2 Study Guide answers by Vitalie)](https://codingideas.blog/core-spring-4-2-study-guide-answers-part-5-security#What_is_the_delegating_filter_proxy/)

2. Version 5, before May 2019
    I've read some blogs about this version of the test. In fact, in the beginning, I prepare the test just according to this version of the study guide. Some useful resources:
    1. [Passed Spring Professional 5.0 certification with 94%.](https://coderanch.com/t/706033/certification/Passed-Spring-Professional-certification)
    2. [Spring Certification 5.0 study notes from MrR0807](https://github.com/MrR0807/SpringCertification5.0)
    3. [Core Spring 5 â€“ Training and Certification](https://www.ivankrizsan.se/2018/04/28/core-spring-5-training-and-certification/)
    4. [How I became a Pivotal Spring Professional Certified 5.0](https://medium.com/@raphaelrodrigues_74842/how-i-became-a-pivotal-spring-professional-certified-5-0-c6348da5f80b)

3. Version 5.x after May 2019
    Before I took the exam, I found that the study guide has been updated. It's not a huge change, but it's enough to fail you if you didn't prepare perfectly. I took me a while to do an extra study on the new topics. It pays. I the test, it has at least 4 questions are about actuator, which is a newly added topic.

    Changes:
    1. Less content on AOP topic. From 14% to 8%.
    2. More Spring Boot content, from 14% to 32%.

### How to study

I recommend you to make your note according to the latest study guide from Pivotal. 
1. Try to answer questions based on official documentation.
2. If cannot, try to read other people's answer based on other people's study notes.
3. Then try to find the answer from some books. 
4. After all the readings, read the official guide again.

The reasons are:
1. People have a different understanding of the same question. However, the only one you need to answer to is Pivotal.
2. Some answers are out of date, or the book you read is about the old version of Spring. 
    For instance, Spring In Action 4th edition has something wrong about Spring Data JPA method name convention. 


### How long it will take?

Hah, it may change a lot depends on your experience, isn't it?

If you've had a look at the links I gave above, a guy spent 5 months on it. A 12-years experienced senior Java developer spent only 40 hours.

It's not easy. So make your plan.

As for me: around 3 months.


### Books I command

The official references are the most useful ones, because it's accurate and update to date. for example, Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2 are released not very long ago. If you still study very old books, it's just a waste of time.
