AWS does everything. This the first step.

## Cloud Basic

- IaaS
- SaaS
- Paas

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Iaas provides access to virtualized computer resources over an Internet connection
- You essentially use IaaS to replace physical resources, such as servers, with virtual resources hosted and managed by Amazon.
- You can use IaaS to replace every physical element in your computing setup except
    - those required to establish and maintain Internet connectivity and 
    - those required to provide nonvirtualized services (such as printing)

Disadvantages:
1. Billing can become complex because some services are billed at different rates and within different time frames.
2. Systems-management monitoring becomes more difficult.
3. A lag often occurs between when a change in service is needed and when the host provides it.
4. Host downtime is unfixable.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- It's also called _software on demand_. 
- It's all about cloud-based applications
- A client typically accesses the application using a local application, such as a browser. The browser runs on local hardware, but the application runs on the host hardware.
- The host, Amazon, maintains the software, provides the required licenses, and does all the other work needed to make the software available.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- PaaS is more of a development solution than a production environment solution.
- For example, Windows is a particular kind of platform. The virtual platform provided by PaaS allows a customer to develop, run, and manage applications of all sorts.


## Major AWS Competitors

- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/products/): the prominence of machine learning services that arenâ€™t found in AWS.

- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) has strong SQL database-management support as well as the connection with the Windows platform that businesses may want to maintain.

- AWS has more to offer in the way of the Internet of Things (IoT), applications, and mobile services.

## Sign Up

To use AWS, you must have two levels of access:

1. User: The first level grants you user-level access to the various services. 

2. Developer: The second level, which you must obtain after getting userlevel access, is developer access. Amazon wants to know who is using its service for a number of reasons, including billing, which means you need a developer ID to obtain the required programmatic access to services.


## Most used AWS Services

1. Amazon S3: storing and retrieving the data
2. EC2 [Elastic Compute Cloud]: develop and deploy applications quickly and effectively for a low cost.
3. AWS Lambda: run code without any server.
4. Glacier: online web storage service that provides you with low cost.
5. Amazon SNS [Simple Notification Service]: manages and delivers the messages or notifications to the users and clients from any cloud platform. 
6. Amazon Elastic Beanstalk: Developers can easily deploy the services and web applications.
7. DynamoDB: NOSQL DB
8. Amazon RDS [Relational Database Service]
9.  Amazon ElastiCache: a memory cache system service on the cloud and supports Redis and Memcached.
10.  Amazon Redshift: a fully managed data warehouse service in the cloud.
